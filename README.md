Cyber Bullying Detection using BERT and BERTopic
Overview
The project aims to detect cyberbullying using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and BERTopic (a topic modeling technique based on BERT).

Features

Cyber bullying detection using machine learning
Text preprocessing and vectorization with BERT
Topic modeling with BERTopic
Classification of text into bullying and non-bullying categories

Usage

Preprocess the text data: Describe the steps to preprocess the text data using BERT. Include any specific preprocessing techniques or functions used.
Vectorize the text: Explain how to use BERT to convert the preprocessed text into numerical vectors.
Topic modeling: Describe how to apply BERTopic to the vectorized text to extract topics.
Bullying detection: Explain how to use a machine learning classifier to classify the text into bullying and non-bullying categories.
